# ReactJs Sessions
[Expedia Code Academy](https://confluence/display/POS/Expedia+Code+Academy+Chicago)

## Setup

1. Join the Slack channel `reactjs-coders`

2. Install node on your computer
    - To check if you have node, enter into your terminal: `node -v`

    - If a version number does not display, download node here:
    [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

3. Have a text editor ready to code
    - Installation instructions (OSX):
        1. Go to [Atom](https://atom.io/) and download the Atom editor.
            - Unzip the downloaded file, then drag the application to your OSX Applications folder.
        2. Once Atom is installed, go to the terminal and enter the command `atom`. This should open up Atom from your terminal.
            - If Atom did not open when you ran the command above, try the following: open atom manually, click "atom" in the menu bar and select "Install Shell Commands" from the dropdown. Then try typing `atom` from the command line again.
            - NOTE: You might have to restart your terminal for this to work.
        3. Install the [react package](https://orktes.github.io/atom-react/) for atom. This will enable JSX syntax highlighting in Atom.
            - Open your terminal
            - Enter the command `apm install react`
            - Restart Atom!
